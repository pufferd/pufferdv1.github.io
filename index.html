		<h1 class="header">Email Communication Expectations</h1>
<br/>		
<p>Due to a large numbers of emails sent from students to faculty that are not communicative, hard to decipher, and/or directed to the wrong person.  
The following describes the expected standard of an email that is sent to a faculty member with regards to this course.</p>

<h3>Subject Line:</h3>
<p>Should contain the Course Code (i.e. <code>WEBD2201</code>) the CRN that you are enquiring or communicating about (e.g. <code>12345</code>) 
and some indication what the email is about.  An acceptable subject line could be (NOTE: the ##### below should be replaced with your lab/lectures section's 5-digit CRN):</p>
<pre style="font-family: verdana";>	WEBD2201 - CRN ##### - Clarification of Lab 5 Requirements</pre>

<h3>Email Body:</h3>
<p>The body of the email should include a greeting (e.g. <span style="font-size: 1.1em; font-family:verdana;">Hello &lt;<em>PLACE YOUR LAB INSTRUCTOR'S NAME HERE</em>
&gt;</span>), followed by your enquiry or whatever information needs to be communicated to the faculty member(s).</p>
<p>You are to consider these exchanges to be formal communication and students are to take 
the time to create emails that look and sound professional. Therefore, you are discouraged from using abbreviations (e.g. <span style="font-style: italic;">U, R, lol, BTW, IDK, AFAIK</span>, etc.) that you might 
use while emailing friends and family members or while texting.</p>
<p>For a succinct explanation of formal versus informal email communication and when to use each check out 
<a href="https://talentegg.ca/incubator/2015/07/10/formal-casual-emails-professionalism-correspondences/">Formal Vs. Casual Emails: How To Keep The Professionalism In 
Your Correspondences</a>.  These are good rules to follow when attempting to find and subsequently keep employment. You should consider your lab and lecture faculty 
as your supervisors in this course.</p>

<h3>Signature Block:</h3>
<p>Finally, there should be a signature block that, at least, includes your first and last name <b>AND</b> your student number.  Example:</p>
<pre style="font-family: verdana";>
	For your consideration,
	Bill Smith
	100123456
</pre>

<h3>Where to send your emails:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Notices of absence for one class, should be sent to the specific instructor whose lab or lecture is going to be missed.</li>
<li>Notices of absence for a period that spans multiple labs and/or lectures, can be sent to both/all instructors by adding both of the email address' in the <em>To:</em> or <em>Cc:</em> field(s). Be sure to include all affected CRNs in the subject line.</li>
<li>Questions or concerns about labs, lab due dates, or lab requirements, should be directed to your lab instructor.</li>
<li>Questions or concerns about term tests, test dates, clarification of concepts and/or course content, should be directed to your lecture instructor.</li>
</ul>
